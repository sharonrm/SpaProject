# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Project #2: Building Your First Full-stack Application

## Overview

This second project is your first foray into **building a full-stack application.** You'll be **building a Node app,** which means you'll learn about what it takes to build a functional application from the ground up yourself.

**This is exciting!** It's a lot, but we've given you the tools to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

**You will be working individually for this project**, and you'll be designing the app yourself. We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project! Sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is one of the the biggest pitfalls for any project!

## Requirements
Your project has 3 required parts: the app, a README markdown file, and a presentation

### Your app must :computer::
* **Have at _least_ 2 models** in the database (more if they make sense) – And should have at _least_ _ONE_ relationship between tables.
* **Use Express, PG-Promise and Mustache-Express**, or an alternative for any of these if you so choose (run it by us first!)
* **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
* **Access data from at least ONE external API** with a form
* **Utilize a database** to interact with your stored data and save API data
* **Include sign up/log in functionality**, with encrypted passwords & authorization with bcrypt
* **Your App must have MVC architecture**
* **Include wireframes** that you designed during the planning process
* Have **semantically clean HTML and CSS**
* **Be deployed online** and accessible to the public
* **Use at least one NPM pacakge** that we have not talked about in class

#### Reach goals :tada::
* **Add additional models**, as is appropriate for your app.
* **Hit more external API's**
* **Utilize additional NPM packages**, NPM has the largest collection of libraries ever made! Try to include something we haven't covered that will be useful for your app!

### Your README.md file must include :memo::
* Explanations of the technologies used
* Wireframes
* User Stories
* The approach taken
* Installation instructions _(if needed)_
* Unsolved problems
* Any other useful information about your app

### Your presentation will consist of :speech_balloon::
- **5 minutes:** A presentation deck _- Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint_
    - At least 5 slides
    - Use easy-to-understand language and avoid too much "technical" terminology
    - Include wireframes that shows your app
    - Answer the following questions:
	      - What is the your app about?
	      - What features does it include?
	      - Were there any constraints you had to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)
	      - Is there any other information you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you've built?
- **2 minutes:** A demo of your app
    - Show the functionality of your app!

  ***Note***</br>
  >We **will** cut you off after the given amounts of time. Likewise if you are *way* under your time, we **will** tell you to stand there until your time is done, so don't skimp out. Plan your presentation accordingly. Practice it!

## Necessary Deliverables

### For the App

* A **working full-stack application, built by you**, hosted on Heroku
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted project,  and frequent commits dating back to the **very beginning** of the project. Commit early, commit often.

### For the README:

* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, wireframes of your app, user stories, etc.

### For the Presentation:

* Create a **5 minute presentation deck** - Google Slides, Keynote, PowerPoint - of at least 5 slides that answers the questions above _(in the presentation requirements section)_
* **Demo** your app!

## Timeline

### Tuesday - Project Proposals: Due Tonight 6/27! :calendar:
* **Spend the evening coming up with ideas and making plans for your app.** By the end of the night, submit your project proposal!
* All proposals should be in the form of an issue attached to this repository.
* __Your proposal should include:__
    - Name of your app
    - [User stories](http://www.mariaemerson.com/user-stories/) that describe how your app will be used.
    - Wireframes!
    - A link to the API you intend to use.
    - A link to the NPM package you intend to use.
    - Foreseen challenges or obstacles
    - Technology you intend to use
    - A link to your repo!

### Wednesday:
* Short review of this unit!
* Start Coding

### Thursday
* __10AM__ - Outcomes checkin
* Work on your projects

### Friday
* Lesson on Heroku and deployment
* Work on your projects

### Saturday - Tuesday
* Work on and finish your projects

## Wednesday:
* **Short presentation on your project** The presentation should include a slide deck about your project, a demo of your app, and time to answer questions the class may have.

## Suggested Ways to Get Started :checkered_flag:

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation, server-side work, API's, authentication) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Write Your Pseudocode** Start by stating the problems in plain text. This will help you guide your process and understand the problem better.
* **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need. State what your **MVP** looks like.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application**. It's tempting to just make them _to-do lists_ for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

## Project Submission :mailbox_with_mail:

Projects will be due **Tuesday July 4:us:** at **11:00 PM**. I know, its a holiday, so plan accordingly! Don't leave stuff for the last day! To submit your project, create an issue on this repository including:

- A link to your project repo
- A link to your Heroku page

You will be presenting your project **Wednesday July 5th**. Be prepared to talk about your project and remember to follow the rules in the requirements section!
